#Reflection

I'm still learning my way around the sqlite gem, but this exercise offered a good refresher on basic SQL commands, schemas, joining tables, etc. I've been working on Michael Hartl's Ruby on the Rails tutorial recently, which led to me downloading the SQLite Database Browser. As a result, I had a nice visual of the code work I completed.

I would like to improve over the next several weeks on long SQL statements and more complex queries. It is a dream of mine to have a data science / consulting type job (Palantir is a company I greatly admire) that in part answers complex questions through complex queries. I know I need to continue to improve and build my database-related skills.

#### I worked on this challenge by myself.

## Release 4: Design your own Schema

Description of what you're modeling: 

The one-to-one schema below represents ESPN's hypothetical model for signing up employees online. ESPN contributers likely are given an ID for posting audio/video/blog content. Every ESPN employee has exactly one ESPN account.

My many-to-many schema connects five different tables: ESPN employees, the radio shows belonging to any ESPN employees, all radio shows, all radio stations that carry ESPN shows and all service providers that serve stations that carry ESPN shows.

## Release 5: Reflection

Schemas represent a useful visual aid for modeling complex relationships between tables in a database. Similar to pseudo code's ability to serve as a framework for good code, beginning with a schema before working on a database seems to me to be an important and necessary step.  

This exercise demonstrated to me the limitless complexity of many to many schemas. Indeed, the massive networking effects created by the internet make tools like SQL invaluable for any programmer working on user experience.

### Reflection

Consistent with the DBC instructions, I found this challenge required me to look up a significant number of SQL commands. I found the tutorials / quizzes rather repetitive / tedious at times and in part did not complete the challenges on "Join" as a result. I worked a significant portion of this week on the [Michael Hartl Rails tutorial] (http://www.railstutorial.org/), which in part discusses SQL.
